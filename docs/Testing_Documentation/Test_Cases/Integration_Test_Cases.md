# Integration Test Cases for Elysium OS

This document outlines the integration test cases for Elysium OS, focusing on the interaction between different modules and services of the system.

## Test Case INT-001: User Authentication Flow

**Objective**: Ensure that the user authentication process works seamlessly with the frontend and backend, including multi-factor, OAuth2, and blockchain-based authentication.

**Preconditions**:
- The user has already signed up for an account.
- The authentication services and database are operational.

**Steps**:
1. Initiate the login process from the frontend `Navbar.js` component.
2. Enter valid user credentials in the login form.
3. Submit the form and verify that the `AuthService.js` sends a request to the backend.
4. The `UserController.js` receives the request and calls `authenticateUser` function.
5. Verify that the user is authenticated and a valid `authToken` is returned.
6. Confirm that the `authToken` is stored correctly in the frontend session storage.
7. Attempt to access a protected route and ensure the `validateAuthToken` middleware allows access.

**Expected Results**:
- The user is authenticated successfully.
- A valid `authToken` is generated and stored.
- The user can access protected routes.

## Test Case INT-002: NFT Purchase Flow

**Objective**: Validate the end-to-end process of purchasing an NFT from the Marketplace, including interaction with smart contracts.

**Preconditions**:
- The user is authenticated and has sufficient cryptocurrency for the purchase.
- The `Marketplace` component and smart contracts are deployed and functional.

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to the `Marketplace/ProductList.js` component in the frontend.
2. Select an NFT to purchase and view its details in `ProductDetail.js`.
3. Initiate the purchase process and verify that `PaymentService.js` is called.
4. `PaymentService.js` interacts with `TransactionContract.sol` to handle the blockchain transaction.
5. Confirm that the `MarketplaceController.js` updates the product's ownership status.
6. Verify that the user's NFT collection is updated to include the newly purchased NFT.

**Expected Results**:
- The blockchain transaction is successful and recorded.
- The NFT ownership is transferred to the buyer.
- The user's NFT collection reflects the new purchase.

## Test Case INT-003: AI Chatbot Integration

**Objective**: Test the integration of the AI chatbot service within the Butler/Consigliere feature.

**Preconditions**:
- The user is authenticated and has access to the Butler/Consigliere feature.
- The `gpt-4_integration/ChatbotService.js` is configured correctly with OpenAI's GPT-4.

**Steps**:
1. Access the Butler/Consigliere dashboard through `ButlerConsigliere/Dashboard.js`.
2. Input a query or command into the chat interface.
3. Verify that the query is sent to `ChatbotService.js`.
4. `ChatbotService.js` processes the query using GPT-4 and returns a response.
5. Confirm that the response is displayed correctly in the dashboard.

**Expected Results**:
- The chatbot provides an accurate and contextually appropriate response.
- The response is displayed promptly in the user interface.

## Test Case INT-004: Game Lobby and Multiplayer Integration

**Objective**: Ensure that the game lobby system integrates properly with the multiplayer backend and gaming engines.

**Preconditions**:
- Multiple users are authenticated and have access to The Arena feature.
- The `Arena/GameLobby.js` and multiplayer infrastructure are operational.

**Steps**:
1. Users navigate to The Arena and join a game lobby through `GameLobby.js`.
2. Verify that `GameController.js` handles the lobby creation and user matchmaking.
3. Once the match is made, confirm that users are able to enter the game.
4. Test in-game communication and ensure that the game state is synchronized across clients.
5. After the game, check that the results are recorded and reflected in user profiles.

**Expected Results**:
- The game lobby correctly matches players and starts the game.
- In-game communication is seamless, and the game state is consistent for all players.
- Game results are accurately recorded and updated in user profiles.

These integration test cases are designed to ensure that the critical features of Elysium OS work together as expected, providing a seamless experience for the users. Each test case should be executed, and any issues found should be documented and addressed by the development team.
